# 2021 Compilation Principle Lab2: LexicalGenerator
***This is a converter that allows for converting NFA to DFA, minimizing DFA, and so on.***  

---
## Requirements
Qt 5.9.9   
c++11

   
## Usages
The regular expression is entered in the editing box in the upper left corner, and the supported operations include: concatenation, parentheses, alternation (|), closure (*), and optional (?).   
The four buttons in the lower left corner are: import a .txt file containing regular expressions, generate analysis results, save the regular expression as a .txt file, and save the generated lexical program as a .txt file.   
On the right side, you can switch and view the NFA, DFA, minimized DFA, and the generated lexical program.
